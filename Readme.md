Introduction-

*A simple dice game using pure JavaScript where two persons will be playing and the person who scores 100 first wins the match.
*It has two buttons roll and hold.
*If you are rolling a dice the score will be added to the temporary score board but in between if your are rolling 1 then the score will become 0 in temporary board.
